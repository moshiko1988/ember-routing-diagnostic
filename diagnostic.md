# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
    Router talks to -> Route and route talks to -> Templates.
    router defines the path..
    route is where you add the model.
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember g route campus/boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md
    {{#link-to 'campus.boston'}}click here {{/link-to}}
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    ```md
    the first one is nested path. if you go show one product from /products it
    will sow it in /products/#id.

    and i think that the socond example will show all the products on the
    /products path
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    params.movie_id
    ```

1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
    from the model.
    we need the {{ }} braces and refer the model that we want.
    ```
